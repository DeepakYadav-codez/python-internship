## 📚 Week 2 Project Summary (Day 10)

This project is part of my Python Developer Internship (Week 2).  
I created a Flask web application using HTML templates, CSS, and user form input.  
I used Flask routing and Jinja2 templating to build a dynamic web app.  
The project taught me how to accept form submissions, handle routes, and render content dynamically.  
I also practiced version control using Git and GitHub.  
This week helped me connect frontend and backend logic in a real-world scenario.
